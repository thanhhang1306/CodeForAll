  <h3> The numbers </h3>
  <ol>
  <li><p> During 2006, only 21.3% of computer science doctorates were earned by women  </p> </li>
  <li><p> In 2008, the percentage of employed women professionals are: </p></li>
  <ul class = "list"> 
    <li> Computer scientist and system analyst: 27.5% </li>
    <li> Computer programmer: 22.4% </li>
    <li> Computer software engineers: 20.9% </li>
    <li> Computer hardware engineers: 19.4% </li>
  </ul>
  <li> <p> While 79% of full time workers with doctorates in 2006 are males, only 15% of full time workers are female </p> </li>
  </ol>
  <hr></hr>
  <h3> Why so few? </h3>
  <ol>
    <li> <p>Cognitive Sex Differences: The notion that men are mathematically superior and innately better suited to STEM fields than women.</p> </li>
    <li> <p>"Just Not Interested": Many women report that they are not interested in computer science. Interest is influenced by many factors, including a belief that one could succeed. Nevertheless, it has been concluded through studies that girls often experience a decrease in confidence in their math and science ability in middle and high school. </p> </li>
    <li> <p> Workplace environment, bias, and family responsibilities: Even when women work in the computer science industry, they have a higher rate than their male peers to leave the field. </li> </p>
  </ol>
  <hr></hr>
  <h3> Possible route to consider  </h3>
  <h2> [note: a more explicit list is in the "Possible Solutions" tab] </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> <p>Cultivate girlsâ€™ achievement and interest in computer science </p> </li>
    <li> <p> Create college (and other educational institutions) environments that support women in compute science</p> </li>
    <li> <p> Counteract the bias present in the field of computer science </li> </p>
  </ol>
